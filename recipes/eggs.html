    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Scrambled eggs are a simple and versatile breakfast dish made by whisking eggs together and then gently cooking them in a pan, typically with a small amount of butter or oil. The eggs are frequently stirred during the cooking process, which creates a soft, fluffy texture. Scrambled eggs can be customized with various seasonings, herbs, vegetables, or cheeses, making them a popular and satisfying meal option.
